FIT Route Converter
===================

This is a serverless solution to the problem of converting a GPX file for
an event into a FIT file that can be used directly by a Garmin Edge cycle
computer.

Development
-----------

Start a local server:

```console
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

The application will be served up on <http://localhost:8080/>.

If you are using Cloud9 then the application will be available on the
workspace URL <http://workspace-username.c9users.io> (`$C9_HOST`).
